# Documentation

This directory contains all project documentation organized by category.

## Directory Structure

### `/history/` - Phase Completion Documents

Historical documents tracking implementation progress through different phases:

- `PHASE_1_COMPLETION.md` - Card enhancement system
- `PHASE_2_COMPLETION.md` - Consumable infrastructure
- `PHASE_3A_COMPLETION.md` - Tarot cards
- `PHASE_3B_COMPLETION.md` - Planet cards & hand leveling
- `PHASE_3C_COMPLETION.md` - Spectral cards
- `PHASE_4_COMPLETION.md` - Boss modifiers (A & B)
- `PHASE_4C_COMPLETION.md` - Boss modifiers (Category C)
- `PHASE_4D_COMPLETION.md` - Boss modifiers (Category D)
- Plus planning documents for each phase

**Purpose**: Track implementation milestones and decisions made during development.

### `/sessions/` - Development Session Summaries

Session-specific documentation capturing work done during development sessions:

- `SESSION_SUMMARY.md` - Comprehensive development session overview (Nov 2025)
- `JOKER_TEST_PROGRESS.md` - Testing session analysis and root cause findings
- `FINAL_JOKER_RESULTS.md` - Success summary of joker system fixes
- `MISSING_JOKERS_ANALYSIS.md` - Analysis of unimplemented jokers by complexity
- `JOKER_COMPLETION_SUMMARY.md` - Summary of joker implementation completion

**Purpose**: Document specific development sessions, discoveries, and breakthroughs.

### `/design/` - Implementation Plans & Design Documents

Design documents and implementation plans for major features:

- `STATEFUL_JOKERS_IMPLEMENTATION.md` - Implementation plan for stateful jokers
- `HAND_DETECTION_REFACTOR.md` - Design document for hand detection refactor

**Purpose**: Provide detailed implementation guidance for complex features.

### `/reference/` - Game Rules & Feature References

Reference documentation for game rules and feature specifications:

- `BALATRO_BASIC_RULES.md` - Complete Balatro game rules reference
- `MISSING_FEATURES_DETAILED.md` - Comprehensive list of unimplemented features
- `JOKERS.md` - Complete reference of all 150 jokers

**Purpose**: Serve as authoritative reference for game mechanics and features.

## Root-Level Documentation

The following documentation files remain at the project root:

- `README.md` - Main project README with quick start and examples
- `CLAUDE.md` - AI assistant instructions for Claude Code
- `PROJECT_STATUS.md` - Comprehensive project status and progress tracker

### For Feature Status
→ See `/PROJECT_STATUS.md` (root) for current status
→ See `/reference/MISSING_FEATURES_DETAILED.md` for detailed missing features

### For Implementation History
→ See `/history/` for phase completion documents
→ See `/sessions/` for development session summaries

### For Implementation Guidance
→ See `/design/` for design documents and plans
→ See `CLAUDE.md` (root) for AI assistant instructions

### For Joker Information
→ See `/reference/JOKERS.md` for complete joker reference

## Documentation Organization Principles

1. **Root level**: Only essential entry-point documentation (README, status, AI instructions)
2. **History**: Phase-based implementation tracking (completed work)
3. **Sessions**: Session-specific discoveries and progress reports
4. **Design**: Forward-looking implementation plans and architecture
5. **Reference**: Authoritative game rules and feature specifications

This organization keeps the root clean while maintaining clear categorization of documentation types.
